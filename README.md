With the coming fall of ICANN I figured it'd be best to provide alternative means of accessing your favorite websites in case of censorship.

Currently I am creating a simple script that will automagically update your hosts file to allow you access to your favorite sites. Right now the program runs from python, I will be changing it in the future to C to prevent any issues. Will likely write some installers for alternative DNS like OpenDNS and so on.
