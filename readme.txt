Feel free to submit requests for your favorite website to be included!

How to use:
In GNU/Linux right click on "run.sh" and select "run in terminal"; note: Requires root.

In Windows double click run.exe

How to add more hosts:
Simply add or remove the domain name and IP address of the server to the included text file 'IPaddresses' and rerun the program.

*While this program does tamper with your hosts file, it does NOT delete your current settings, it merely appends the file so you don't need to worry about the loopback, localhost, etc. or any other previously included entries.
